This file documents user-visible changes in Couchbase clustering & UI.
======================================================================

-----------------------------------------
Between versions 2.1.0 and 2.2.0
-----------------------------------------

* (MB-8663) per xdc-replication settings were implemented

  Now we provide two REST endpoints for changing XDCR settings:

    - /settings/replications/ — for global settings
    - /settings/replications/<replication id> — for per-replication
      settings

  Additionally to that, internalSettings/ can also still be used for
  updating some of the global XDCR settings.


  Per replication settings (/settings/replications/<replication id>)

    Supported parameters:

    Any subset of parameters can be overridden on per-replication
    basis. To make replication use global value for certain parameter
    pass empty value. In case of success, server responds with 200
    status and a JSON object representing resulting per-replication
    settings. In case of error, server responds with 400 status and
    returns a JSON object describing the errors.

    Examples:

    $ curl -X GET -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/c2a76ddac3bafe1cbc0e7ac2a48d6ff9%2fdefault%2ftest
    {
      "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
      "failureRestartInterval": 30,
      "workerBatchSize": 500,
      "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
      "maxConcurrentReps": 64,
      "checkpointInterval": 600
    }


    $ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/c2a76ddac3bafe1cbc0e7ac2a48d6ff9%2fdefault%2ftest \
           -d maxConcurrentReps=32 -d checkpointInterval=1800
    {
      "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
      "failureRestartInterval": 30,
      "workerBatchSize": 500,
      "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
      "maxConcurrentReps": 32,
      "checkpointInterval": 1800
    }


    $ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/c2a76ddac3bafe1cbc0e7ac2a48d6ff9%2fdefault%2ftest \

      "failureRestartInterval": 30,
      "workerBatchSize": 500,
      "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
      "checkpointInterval": 1800
    }

    $ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/c2a76ddac3bafe1cbc0e7ac2a48d6ff9%2fdefault%2ftest \
           -d maxConcurrentReps=1024
    {
      "maxConcurrentReps": "The value must be an integer between 2 and 256"
    }

  Global settings (/settings/replications/)
  =========================================

    The endpoint for global settings is very similar. The supported
    parameters are all the same as for per-replications endpoint plus
    the following:

    +------------------+--------------+---------------+
    |       Name       |     Type     | Default value |
    |                  |              |               |
    +------------------+--------------+---------------+
    | traceDumpInvprob | int ∈ [1, ∞) |           1000|
    +------------------+--------------+---------------+

    The only difference in behavior is that it's not possible to unset
    certain parameter.

    Examples:

    $ curl -X GET -u Administrator:asdasd http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/
    {
      "traceDumpInvprob": 1000,
      "socketOptions": {
        "nodelay": false,
        "keepalive": true
      },
      "localConflictResolution": false,
      "enablePipelineOps": true,
      "xmemWorker": 1,
      "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
      "retriesPerRequest": 2,
      "maxConcurrentReps": 32,
      "checkpointInterval": 1800,
      "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
      "failureRestartInterval": 30,
      "workerBatchSize": 500,
      "connectionTimeout": 180,
      "workerProcesses": 4,
      "httpConnections": 20
    }

    $ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/ -d traceDumpInvprob=1
    {
      "traceDumpInvprob": 1,
      "socketOptions": {
        "nodelay": false,
        "keepalive": true
      },
      "localConflictResolution": false,
      "enablePipelineOps": true,
      "xmemWorker": 1,
      "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
      "retriesPerRequest": 2,
      "maxConcurrentReps": 32,
      "checkpointInterval": 1800,
      "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
      "failureRestartInterval": 30,
      "workerBatchSize": 500,
      "connectionTimeout": 180,
      "workerProcesses": 4,
      "httpConnections": 20
    }

    $ curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
           http://127.0.0.1:9000/settings/replications/ -d traceDumpInvprob=0
    {
      "traceDumpInvprob": "The value must be an integer between 1 and infinity"
    }


* (MB-8801) we introduced the script for resetting administrative
  password either to automatically generated or to user specified
  value

  USAGE: make sure that the server is started and then run
  cbreset_password from the bin directory. the script will
  guide you through password resetting process

* (MB-8656) we've allowed adding vm flags of child vm via env variable

  By setting environment variable COUCHBASE_NS_SERVER_VM_EXTRA_ARGS it
  is now possible to add erlang vm flags of child vm. It is interpreted
  as erlang term which must represent list of strings.

  E.g. in order to pass +swt low you can do the following:

    COUCHBASE_NS_SERVER_VM_EXTRA_ARGS='["+swt", "low"]' ./cluster_run


* (MB-8569) live filtration of list of documents in UI was
  removed. This code is using un-optimized implementation of searching
  list of documents and that caused non-trivial use of memory which
  could lead to server crash.

* (MB-7398 (revision)) (see MB-7398 below as part of 2.1.0 changes) As
  part of fixing MB-8545 below we found that there's no way to switch
  any node back from manually assigned name to automatically managed
  name. We now reset node's name back to 127.0.0.1 and automatic name
  management when it's leaving cluster. I.e. previously node always
  kept it's name even after it was rebalanced out.

* (MB-8465)(windows only) quite embarrasing and quite intensive memory
  leak in one of our child processes was found. It is now fixed.

* (MB-8545) we've found that hostname management (see MB-7398 below)
  is not really effective if hostname is assigned before joining 2.0.1
  cluster. That was because if node was joined via 2.0.1 node it would
  always revert to automatically assigned address.

  Proposed workaround is to join 2.1.0 nodes via 2.1.0. Clearly,
  during rebalance upgrade first 2.1.0 node has to be joined via 2.0.1
  node. In which case see jira ticket for further workaround.

  This is now fixed.

-----------------------------------------
Between versions 2.0.1 and 2.1.0
-----------------------------------------

* (MB-8046) We don't allow data and config directories to be
  world-readable anymore. Which was a potential local vulnerability.

* (MB-8045) Default value of rebalanceMovesBeforeCompaction was raised
  to 64 for severe gains in rebalance time.

* (MB-7398) There's now full support of assigning symbolic hostnames
  to cluster nodes that replaces old "manual" and kludgy
  procedure. Now as part of node setup wizard there's input field to
  assign it a name. When node is added to cluster as part of Add
  Server button (or corresponding REST API), then IP address or name
  that's used to specify that node is attempted to be assigned to this
  node.

  There's also new REST API call for renaming node.

  POST to /node/controller/rename with hostname parameter will trigger
  node rename.

  Using hostnames instead of relying on built-in detection of node ip
  address is recommended in environments where ip addresses are
  volatile. I.e. EC2 or developer's laptop(s) in network where
  addresses are assigned via DHCP.

* (CBD-220) Erlang VM was split into 2. One is called babysitter
  VM. That erlang VM instance is only capable of starting and
  babysitting main erlang VM as well as memcached and moxi. Babysitter
  is designed to be small and simple and thus very unlikely to crash
  or be affected by any bug.

  Most user-visible effect of this change is that crash of main erlang
  VM (e.g. due to lack of memory) cannot bring down memcached or moxi
  anymore.

  But it also finally enables same ip address/hostname management
  features on windows just like it works for as any other OS. That's
  because erlsrv which is a way to run erlang VM as windows service
  does not allow changing node name at runtime. But because now
  service just runs babysitter which we don't need to rename, we are
  now able to run main erlang VM in a way that allows node to rename
  itself.

  This change also enables some more powerful ways of on-line
  upgrade. I.e. we'll be able to shoot old version of "erlang bits" in
  the head and start new version. All that without interfering with
  running instance of memcached or moxi.

  There's new set of log files for log messages from babysitter
  VM. cbcollect_info will save them as ns_server.babysitter.log.

  See also doc/some-babysitting-details.txt in source tree.

* (MB-7574) Support for REST call /pools/default/stats is discontinued.

  This REST call was meant to aggregate stats for several buckets. And
  it used to do so long time ago (Northscale Server 1.0.3). But after
  'membase' bucket type was introduced, it worked only for a single
  bucket and failed with badmatch error otherwise. The proper way to
  grab bucket stats now is /pools/default/buckets/<bucket name>/stats
  REST call.

* (CBD-771) Stats archives are not stored in mnesia anymore.

  Instead they are collected in ETS tables and saved to plain files
  from time to time. This means historical stats from pre-upgrade to
  2.0.2 is going to be lost.

* (CBD-816) Recovery mode support

  When a membase (couchbase) bucket has some vbuckets missing it can
  be put into a recovery mode using startRecovery REST call:

   curl -sX POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
        http://lh:9000/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/startRecovery

  In case of success, the response looks as follows:

   {
       "code": "ok",
       "recoveryMap": [
           {
               "node": "n_1@10.17.40.207",
               "vbuckets": [
                   33,
                   34,
                   35,
                   36,
                   37,
                   38,
                   39,
                   40,
                   41,
                   42,
                   54,
                   55,
                   56,
                   57,
                   58,
                   59,
                   60,
                   61,
                   62,
                   63
               ]
           }
       ],
       "uuid": "8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563"
   }

  So in this case replica vbuckets 33-42 and 54-63 were created on
  node n_2@10.17.40.207. Now the client can start pushing data to
  these vbuckets.

  All the important recovery URIs are advertised via tasks:

   curl -sX GET -u 'Administrator:asdasd' http://lh:9000/pools/default/tasks

   [
       {
           "bucket": "default",
           "commitVbucketURI": "/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/commitVBucket?recovery_uuid=8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563",
           "recommendedRefreshPeriod": 10.0,
           "recoveryStatusURI": "/pools/default/buckets/default/recoveryStatus?recovery_uuid=8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563",
           "stopURI": "/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/stopRecovery?recovery_uuid=8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563",
           "type": "recovery",
           "uuid": "8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563"
       },
       {
           "status": "notRunning",
           "type": "rebalance"
       }
   ]

   - stopURI can be used to abort the recovery
   - recoveryStatusURI will return information about the recovery in the
     same format as startRecovery
   - commitVBucketURI will activate certain vbucket

     This call should be used after the client is done with pushing
     the data to it. VBucket is passed as a POST parameter:

      curl -sX POST -u 'Administrator:asdasd' \
           http://lh:9000/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/commitVBucket?recovery_uuid=8e02b3a84e0bbf58cbbb58919f1a6563 \
           -d vbucket=33

      {
          "code": "ok"
      }


  All the recovery related REST calls return a JSON object having a
  "code" field. This (together with HTTP status code) indicates if the
  call was successful.

  Here's a complete list of possible REST calls replies.

  Recovery map generation is very simplistic. It just distributes
  missing vbuckets to the available nodes and tries to ensure that
  nodes get about the same number of vbuckets. It's not always
  possible though, because after failover we often have quite
  unbalanced map. The resulting map is likely very unbalanced too. And
  recovered vbuckets are not even replicated. So in a nutshell,
  recovery is not a means of avoiding rebalance. It's suitable only
  for recovering data. And rebalance will be needed anyway.

* (MB-8013) Detailed rebalance progress implemented.

  This gives user an estimate of the number of items to be transferred
  from each node during rebalance, number of items transferred so far,
  number of vbuckets to be moved in/out of the node. This works on a
  per bucket level so we also show which bucket is being rebalanced
  right now and how many has already been rebalanced.

* (MB-8199) REST and CAPI request throttler implemented.

  It's behavior is controlled by three parameters which can be set via
  /internalSettings REST endpoint:

    - restRequestLimit

      Maximum number of simultaneous connections each node should
      accept on REST port. Diagnostics related endpoints and
      /internalSettings are not counted.

    - capiRequestLimit

      Maximum number of simultaneous connections each node should
      accept on CAPI port. It should be noted that it includes XDCR
      connections.

    - dropRequestMemoryThresholdMiB

      The amount of memory used by Erlang VM that should not be
      exceeded. If it's exceeded the server will start dropping
      incoming connections.

  When the server decides to reject incoming connection because some
  limit was exceeded, it does so by responding with status code of 503
  and Retry-After header set appropriately (more or less). On REST
  port textual description of why request was rejected returned in a
  body. On CAPI port in CouchDB tradition a JSON object is returned
  with "error" and "reason" fields.

  By default all the thresholds are set to be unlimited.

-----------------------------------------
Between versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
-----------------------------------------

* (CBD-790) new REST call:
  empty POST request to
  /pools/default/buckets/<bucketname>/controller/unsafePurgeBucket
  will trigger a special type of forced compaction that will "forget"
  deleted items.

  Normally couchstore keeps deletion "tombstones" forever, which
  naturally creates space problem for some use-cases (i.e. session
  stores). But tombstones are required for XDCR. So this unsupported
  and undocumented facility is only safe to use when XDCR is not used
  and was never used.

* orchestration of vbucket moves during rebalance was changed to make
  rebalance faster in some cases. Most important change is that
  vbucket move is now split into two phases. During first phase tap
  backfills happen (i.e. bulk of data is sent to replicas and future
  master), second phase is when we're waiting for index update
  completion and performing "consistent" views takeover. First phase
  (like entire vbucket move in previous version) is sequential. Node
  only performs one in- or out-going backfill at a time. But second
  phase is allowed to proceed in parallel. We've found that it allows
  index updater to see larger batches and be "utilized" larger share
  of the time.

  New moves orchestration also attempts to keep all nodes busy all the
  time. Which is especially visible on rebalance out tests, where all
  remaining nodes need to index about same subset of data. 2.0.0
  couldn't keep all the nodes busy all the time. Data moved from
  rebalanced out node was essentially indexed sequentially, vbucket
  after vbucket.

  See tickets: MB-6726 and MB-7523

  Old implementation was seen to often start with (re)building
  replicas. New moves orchestration on the other hand attempts to
  move active vbuckets sooner, so that mutations are more evently
  spread sooner.

  We've also found that we need to coordinate index compactions with
  massive index updates that happen as part of rebalance. Main reason
  for that is given that all vbuckets of node are indexed in single
  file. This file can be big. And compacting it is quite heavy
  operation. Given that couch-style rebalance has performance issues
  when there's heavy mutations at same time as compaction (i.e. it has
  to reapply them to new version of file after bulk compaction is
  done), we have seen massive waste of CPU and disk if view compaction
  happens in parallell with index updating.

  To prevent that we allow 16 moves (configurable via internal UI
  settings) to be made to or from any given node, after which index
  compaction is forced (unless disabled via other internal
  setting). During moves, view compaction is disabled. We've found it
  solves problem of huge disk space blowup during rebalance: MB-6799.

  New internal setting (POST-able to /internalSettings and changeable
  via internal settings UI) rebalanceMovesBeforeCompaction allows to
  change that number of moves before compaction "constant".

* Heavy timeouts caused by lack of +A erlang option were finally
  fixed. We couldn't enable it previously due to crash in Erlang that
  this option seemingly caused. We managed to understand problem and
  implemented workaround, which allowed as to get back to +A. See
  MB-7182.

* Another, less frequent, cause of timeouts was addressed too. We've
  found that major and even minor page faults can significantly
  degrate erlang latencies. As part of MB-6595 we're now locking
  erlang pages in ram (so that kernel doesn't evict them e.g. to swap)
  and we also tuned erlang's memory allocator to be far less agressive
  in returned previously used pages to kernel.

* bucket flush REST API call is now allowed with just bucket
  credentials, instead of always requiring admin credentials in
  past. MB-7381

* We closed dangerous, but windows-specific security problem in
  "MB-7390: Prohibit arbitrary access to files on Windows"

* windows was also taught not to pick link local addresses. MB-7417

* subtle issue on offline upgrade from 1.8.x was fixed (MB-7369
  MB-7370)

* views whose names have slashes work now. MB-7193

-----------------------------------------
Between versions 1.8.1 and 2.0.0
-----------------------------------------

We didn't keep changelog for 2.0.0 release. It has too many new
features to mention here.

* we have internal settings API and UI. API is GET and POST to
  /internalSettings. UI is hidden by default but it'll be visible if
  index.html is replaced with index.html?enableInternalSettings=1 in
  UI url.


-----------------------------------------
Between versions 1.8.0 and 1.8.1
-----------------------------------------

* ruby is not required anymore to build ns_server (and afaik rest of
  couchbase server)

* bucket deletion now waits for all nodes to complete deletion of
  bucket. But note there's timeout and it's set to 30 seconds.

* delete bucket request now correctly returns error during rebalance
  instead of crashing

* create bucket request now returns 503 instead of 400 during
  rebalance.

* bucket deletion errors are now correctly displayed on UI

* we're now using our own great logging library: ale. Formatting of
  log messages is greatly improved. With different log categories and
  separate log files for error and info (and above) levels. So that
  high-level and important messages are preserved longer without
  compromising detailedness of debug logs. A lot of improvements to
  quality of logged messages were made. Another user-visible change is
  much faster grabbing of logs.

* couchbase_server script now implements reliable
  shutdown. I.e. couchbase_server -k will gracefully shutdown server
  persisting all pending mutations before exiting. Actual service stop
  invocation is synchronous.

* during rebalance vbucket map is now updated after each vbucket
  move. Providing better guide for (perhaps not so) smart clients.

* new-style mb_master transition grace period is now over. 1.8.1 can
  coexist (and support online upgrade from) membase 1.7.2 and
  above. Versions before that are not supported because they don't
  support new-style master election.

* (MB-4554) stats gathering is now using wall clock time instead of
  erlang's now function. erlang:now is based on wall clock time, but
  by definition cannot jump backwards. So certain ntp time adjustments
  caused issues for stats gathering previously.

* scary looking retry_not_ready_vbuckets log message was
  fixed. ebucketmigrator process can sometimes restart itself when
  some of it's source vbucket were not ready when replication was
  started. That restart was looking like crash. Now it's fixed.

* vbucket map generation code now generates maps with optimal "moves"
  from current map in the following important cases. When adding back
  previously failed over node (assuming every other node is same and
  healthy) and when performing "swap rebalance". Swap rebalance is
  when you simultaneously add and remove N nodes. Where N can be any
  natural number (up to current cluster size of course). Rebalance is
  now significantly faster when this conditions apply.

* (MB-4476) couchbase server now support node cloning better. You can
  use clone snapshot of empty node and join those VMs into single
  cluster.

* couchbase server is not more robust when somebody tries to create
  bucket when bucket with same name is still being shut down on any of
  nodes

* annoying and repeating log message when there is memcached type
  buckets, but some nodes are not yet rebalanced it is now fixed

* bug causing couchbase to return 500 error instead of gracefully
  returning error when bucket parameter "name" is missing is now fixed

* few races when node that orchestrates rebalance is being rebalanced
  out are now fixed. Previously it was possible to see rebalance as
  running and other 'rebalance-in-flight' config effects when it was
  actually completed.

* bug causing failed over node to not delete it's data files was
  fixed. Note: previously it was only possible when node was added back
  after being failed over.

* couchbase server now performs rebalance more safely. It builds new
  replicas before switching to them. It's now completely safe to stop
  rebalance at any point without risking data loss

* due to safer rebalance we're now deleting old vbuckets as soon as
  possible during rebalance. Making further vbucket movements faster

* couchbase server avoids reuse of tap names. Previous versions had
  release notes that recommended to avoid rebalancing for 5 minutes
  after stopped or failed rebalance. That problem is now fixed.

* (MB-4906 Always fetch autofailover count from config) bug when
  certain sequence of events could lead to autofailover breaking it's
  limit of single node to fail over was fixed

* (MB-4963) old "issue" of UI reporting rebalance as failed when it
  was in fact stopped by user is now fixed

* (MB-5020) bug causing rebalance to be incorrectly displayed as
  running preventing failover was fixed

* (MB-4023) couchbase server now using dedicated memcached port for
  it's own stats gathering, orchestration, replication and
  rebalance. Making it more robust against mis-configured clients.

* /diag/masterEvents cluster events streaming facility was
  implemented. See doc/master-events.txt for more details.

* (MB-4564) during failover and rebalance out couchbase server now
  leaves data files. So that accident failover does not leads to
  catastrophic data loss. Those files are deleted when node is
  rebalanced back in or becomes independent single-node cluster.

* (MB-4967) couchbase_num_vbuckets_default ns_config variable (absent
  by default) can now be used to change number of vbuckets for any
  couchbase buckets created after that change. The only way to change
  it is via /diag/eval.

* mastership takeover is now clearly logged

* (MB-4960) mem_used and some other stats are now displayed on UI

* (MB-5050) autofailover service is now aware that it's not possible
  to fail over during rebalance

* (MB-5063) couchbase server now disallows attempts to rebalance out
  unknown nodes instead of misbehaving

* (MB-5019) bug when create bucket dialog was displaying incorrect
  remaining quote right after bucket deletion is now fixed

* internal cluster management stats counters facility was
  implemented. The only way so far to see those stats is in diags or
  by posting 'system_stats_collector:get_ns_server_stats().' to
  /diag/eval. So far only few stats related to reliable replica
  building during rebalance are gathered.

* diags now have tap & checkpoint stats from memcached on all nodes

* local tap & checkpoints stats are now logged after rebalance and
  each 30 seconds during rebalance

* (MB-5256) but with alert not being generated for failures to save
  item mutatins to disk was fixed

* (MB-5275) bug with alerts not being shown to user sometimes was fixed

* (MB-5408) ns_memcached now implements smarter queuing and
  prioritization of heavy & light operations. Leading to hopefully
  much less memcached timeouts. Particularly vbucket delete operation
  is known to be heavy. By running it on separate worker we allow
  stats requests to be performed without delays and thus hopefully
  without hitting timeouts.

* simple facility to adjust some timeouts at runtime was
  implemented. Example, usage is this diag/eval snippet:
    ns_config:set({node, node(), {timeout, ns_memcached_outer_very_heavy}}, 120000).
  Which will bump timeout for most heavy ns_memcached calls up to 120
  seconds (most timeouts are in milliseconds)

* config replication was improved to avoid avalanche of config NxN
  replications caused by incoming config replications. Now only
  locally produced replications are forcefully pushed to all
  nodes. Note: old random gossip is still there. As well as somewhat
  excessive full config push & pull to newly discovered node(s).

* it's now possible to change max concurrent rebalance movers
  count. Post the following to /diag/eval to set it to 4:
    ns_config:set(rebalance_moves_per_node, 4).
